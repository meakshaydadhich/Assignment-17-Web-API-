    "# information.\n",
    "\n",
    "# For example, consider a weather application on your smartphone. When you open the app to check the weather, it sends a request\n",
    "# to a weather service's API. The API then retrieves the weather data from the server and sends it back to your app in a format \n",
    "# it can understand, like JSON. This way, you can see the current temperature, forecast, and other weather details without \n",

    "# Q.4 Explain REST and SOAP Architecture. Mention shortcomings of SOAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ans.\n",
    "\n",
    "# REST (Representational State Transfer) Architecture:\n",
    "# REST is an architectural style that uses simple, stateless communication, often over HTTP/HTTPS, to interact with web \n",
    "# services. It is commonly used for developing Web APIs and focuses on scalability, simplicity, and flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "# SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) Architecture:\n",
    "# SOAP is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services. It is XML-based and follows a \n",
    "# stricter set of rules for message format and structure, often over HTTP or SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Shortcomings of SOAP:\n",
    "# Complexity: SOAP is more complex due to its strict messaging structure (XML), extensive standards, and WSDL.\n",
    "    \n",
    "# Performance: SOAP is slower than REST because of the overhead caused by XML parsing and the larger message sizes. This results\n",
    "#              in more bandwidth usage.\n",
    "        \n",
    "# Verbosity: SOAP messages are more verbose due to the XML format, which increases payload size and negatively impacts\n",
    "#            performance.\n",
    "        \n",
    "# Tightly Coupled: SOAP often requires clients to understand the service contract (WSDL) to interact, leading to tight coupling\n",
    "#                 between client and server.\n",
    "        \n",
    "# Limited Browser Support: SOAP does not work as well with browsers, making it less suitable for modern web applications \n",
    "#                          compared to REST.\n",
    "# Platform Specificity: While SOAP is transport-independent, it can be more platform-dependent due to its reliance on certain\n",
    "#                     standards like WS-Security or WS-ReliableMessaging, which may not be fully supported across all platforms\n",
    "        \n",
    "# Less Flexibility with Data Formats: SOAP only supports XML, while REST can work with different data formats such as JSON, XML,\n",
    "#                                     and more.\n",
    "        \n",

    "# Q.5 Differentiate between REST and SOAP\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ans.\n",
    "#  1. Architecture vs. Protocol:\n",
    "#    - REST: This is an architectural style designed for web services. It is based on HTTP.\n",
    "#    - SOAP: This is a protocol that defines specific rules and standards for web services.\n",
    "\n",
    "#  2. Data Format:\n",
    "#    - REST: It supports multiple formats like JSON, XML, HTML, or plain text. JSON is commonly used because it is lightweight.\n",
    "#    - SOAP: It only transfers data in XML format, which tends to be heavier.\n",
    "\n",
    "#  3. State Management:\n",
    "#    - REST: It is stateless, meaning each request is independent, and the server does not remember the client’s state.\n",
    "#    - SOAP: It can be stateful, meaning the server can remember the client’s state.\n",
    "\n",
    "#  4. Ease of Use:\n",
    "#    - REST: It is easier to use since it utilizes simple HTTP methods.\n",
    "#    - SOAP: It is more complex due to the use of WSDL, XML, and additional standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "#  5. Performance:\n",
    "#    - REST: It is lightweight and faster, as it uses less bandwidth.\n",
    "#    - SOAP: It can be slower because the size of XML messages is larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "#  6. Error Handling:\n",
    "#    - REST: It handles errors using HTTP status codes.\n",
